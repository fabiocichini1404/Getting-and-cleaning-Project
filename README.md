Files
The variables are described in a file called CodeBook.md and in file run_analysis.R we have the 5 steps required in the course projectâ€™s:
1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

After all these step, it was generated the file Finish.txt
